## S3 Static Website Hosting

### What I Did (Hands-on)

- Created an Amazon S3 bucket using AWS Management Console
- Disabled block public access for static website hosting
- Uploaded `index.html` file
- Enabled static website hosting
- Applied bucket policy to allow public read access
- Accessed the website using the S3 website endpoint

### Why Amazon S3 Was Used

- No server management required
- Highly durable object storage (11 nines ( 99.999999999 % ))
- Very low cost
- Automatically scalable

### AWS Concepts Learned

### Cost Awareness

- Charged based on storage and requests

### Exam Relevance (CLF-C02)
